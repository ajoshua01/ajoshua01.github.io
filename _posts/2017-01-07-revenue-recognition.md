    <p>The new accounting standard for revenue recognition will likely affect every aspect of a business that relates to revenue, from a company’s financial results and compliance with debt covenants to executive compensation. Yet surveys show that many companies are dragging their feet and have yet to begin preparing for this impending change, which means some may be dangerously behind.
</p> <p>Although the first financial reports that will be required to use the new revenue recognition standard are still more than a year off, for many companies the reporting periods that are subject to the new standard are already underway. Also, many organizations that have started to implement the required changes are finding the process to be much more complex and time-consuming than they expected — with implications that go far beyond accounting. This is sobering news for companies that are procrastinating in the hope of pulling off a last-minute miracle.</p>
<p>Here are five key areas that companies will need to address as they implement the new revenue recognition standard.
</p>
<p><strong>Accounting.</strong> The new standard specifically focuses on how companies recognize revenue associated with customer contracts. In the past, there was wide variation in how revenue was recognized — particularly among different industries and geographies. The new standard, which was jointly developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), provides a globally consistent framework that strives to recognize revenue more consistently, both in terms of timing and earned monetary value.</p>
<p> To achieve its goal, the new standard relies much more heavily on estimates and judgments. This in turn requires additional data gathering and reporting, including extensive disclosures — not only about the data used, but also about the judgments that were applied when producing the estimates.</p>
<p>Revising a company’s accounting processes and controls to support this new approach is a significant undertaking that could take much longer than a CFO might think – and along the way the CFO should consult with the company’s auditors, as well as, when appropriate, FASB, IASB, and the SEC.</p>
<p><strong>IT systems.</strong> Compliance with the new revenue recognition standard will almost certainly require data that is not currently being collected, aggregated, or reported.

For example, many existing IT systems were not designed to capture material rights as performance obligations, which is a requirement under the new revenue recognition standard. Similarly, many IT systems do not currently capture and track the start and end dates for contracts, which is now required. Also, many data elements in contracts are text fields that make it difficult for companies to extract the specific information needed to automate certain revenue recognition processes.</p>

Designing, developing, and testing the necessary system modifications could take many months to complete, especially since it will generally require custom software development — not just installation of a standard update.
System changes of this nature cannot be thrown together at the eleventh hour, which is one of the key reasons it is so important to get started right away.
