      <p>This firm has had tremendous success filing Form 1023 for our clients seeking nonprofit tax-exempt status. The process can be daunting and requires a high attention to detail.<br> It can involve an overwhelming amount of paperwork and storytelling.</p>
      <h2>Choice of Organization type:</h2>
      <p>Forming a nonprofit begins with a discussion of the nonprofit&rsquo;s operations and vision. <br>Chapter 501 of the Internal Revenue Code offers multiple kinds of tax exempt operations. 501(c)3, specifically, provides an exemption for:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Religious;</li>
      <li>Charitable;</li>
      <li>Scientific;</li>
      <li>Literary;</li>
      <li>Educational</li>
      <li>Organizations that test for public safety;</li>
      <li>Organizations that foster national or international sports competition;</li>
      <li>Organizations for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals;</li>
      <li>And a few others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Each category has its own set of regulations and case law that must be considered when structuring your nonprofit&rsquo;s operations. Violating any of these requirements may result in your organization losing its tax-exempt status and being subject to federal and state income and other taxes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Other provisions of the tax code provide for the creation of private foundations, title-holding corporations, civic organizations, and others.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Applying for tax-exempt status requires completion of IRS form 1023 or 1023-EZ. Generally, an organization will not be regarded as exempt until the organization has applied for and received tax-exempt status from the IRS. It is important to note that this determination is only valid so long as the operations of the organization do not materially change. <br>Therefore, it is important to consult an attorney on retainer to continuously consult on the Company&rsquo;s compliance with its tax-free determination.</p>
