<h1 style="text-align: center">Families First Coronavirus Response Act: Employee Expanded Family and Medical Leave Rights</h1>
<p>The <strong>Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) </strong> requires certain employers to provide employees with expanded family and medical leave 
for specified reasons related to COVID-19. The Department of Labor’s (Department) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) 
administers and enforces the new law’s paid leave requirements. These provisions will apply from the effective date through <strong> December 31, 2020</strong>.</p>
	<br>
<p>Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:</p>
	<br>
<ol><li><em>Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of <strong>expanded family and medical leave</strong> at the employee’s regular rate of pay</em> where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or</li>
	<br><li><em>Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of <strong>expanded family and medical leave</strong> at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay</em> because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and</li>
	<br><li><em>Up to an additional 10 weeks of <strong>expanded family and medical leave</strong> at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay</em> where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Covered Employers:</strong> The expanded family and medical leave provisions of the FFCRA apply to certain public employers, and private employers with fewer than 500 employees.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Most employees of the federal government are covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by this Act, and are therefore not covered by the expanded family and medical leave provisions of the FFCRA. However, federal employees covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act are covered by the paid sick leave provision. </p>

<p>Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees may qualify for exemption from the requirement to provide leave due to school closings or child care unavailability if the leave requirements would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.</p>

<p><strong>Eligible Employees:</strong> <em>All employees</em> of covered employers are eligible for two weeks of expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. <em>Employees employed for at least 30 days</em> are eligible for up to an additional 10 weeks of paid family leave to care for a child under certain circumstances related to COVID-19.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Where leave is foreseeable, an employee should provide notice of leave to the employer as is practicable. After the first workday of expanded family and medical leave, an employer may require employees to follow reasonable notice procedures in order to continue receiving expanded family and medical leave.</p>

<p>Qualifying Reasons for Leave:</p>

<p>Under the FFCRA, an employee qualifies for expanded family and medical leave if the employee is unable to work (<strong>or unable to telework</strong>) due to a need for leave because the employee:</p>

<ol><li>is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19;</li>
	<li>has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19;</li>
	<li>is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis;</li>
	<li>is caring for an individual subject to an order described in (1) or self-quarantine as described in (2);</li>
	<li>is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19; or</li>
	<li>is experiencing any other substantially-similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury.</li>
</ol><p>Under the FFCRA, an employee qualifies for expanded family and medical leave if the employee is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19.</p>
<br>
<p> <strong>Any individual whose employer fails to comply with these new rules or who requires you to return to work in violation of <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-charlie-baker-orders-all-non-essential-businesses-to-cease-in-person-operation"> Governor Baker's March 23 Order </a> should contact my office immediately.</strong>
